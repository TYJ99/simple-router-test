# Building a Simple Router
1. Building a simple router. It will receive raw Ethernet frames and we handle those packets with ARP request, ARP reply, ARP caching, ICMP (send messages back to a sending host), Switching, Longest Prefix Match, IP sanity-check (minimum length and checksum), and the other essential features for IP forwarding.  
2. Support ping and traceroute for both clients and servers, and download a file using HTTP from one of the app servers.  
3. Implement Longest Prefix Match using Trie.
